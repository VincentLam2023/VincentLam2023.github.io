                I created a simple calculator using html, css, and javascript.
                The purpose of this project was to create a working calculator.
                The calculator is able to perform addition, subtarction,
                multiplication, divition, power, modulus and generate a random
                number. Css and html was used to make an interactive ui, while
                javascript was used to perform the calcuations.

                I created an animation using html, css, and javascript utilizing
                the p5.js library. The purpose of this project was to create an
                animation of bouncing balls that will remain inside of the
                canvas/screen. In addition to the animation the user can pasue
                and play the animation at anytime with a press of the mouse. The
                user can also reset the animation with a press of any of the
                keys from a keyboard. The user can also move the mouse around
                and the balls will be repled from the mouse. Html and css was
                used to create the canvas that the balls would be displayed on.
                Javascript was used to generate the balls, and how they would
                act on the screen. Javascript was also used for user
                interactivity.

                This Power BI project analyzes human cognitive performance based
                on lifestyle factors such as sleep duration, stress level,
                caffeine intake, screen time, and more. Using two integrated
                datasets—human_cognitive_performance.csv and
                StudentPerformanceFactors.csv—the project identifies key trends
                and correlations, builds predictive models, and reveals hidden
                patterns through clustering. The goal is to inform health and
                productivity decisions by visualizing and predicting how daily
                habits affect mental sharpness. Key highlights include a clear
                negative impact of screen time on cognitive scores, strong
                predictive accuracy for memory performance using a Random Forest
                model, and segmentation of users based on lifestyle clusters.
                The application incorporates Python visualizations and machine
                learning models, including one developed in Azure ML.
